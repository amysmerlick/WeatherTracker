# WeatherTracker


# _**Introduction**_
***
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. We have been challenged to create and build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) we will be able to retrieve weather data for cities.
