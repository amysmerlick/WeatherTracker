# WeatherTracker


# _**Introduction**_
***
Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp has assigned us with the task of creating our very own portfolio that can showcase our progress over the next 24 weeks. This portfolio has been quite challenging, as we had to build code from scratch. I used the tools I learned from the first 2 weeks of class. This portfolio was built using CSS techniques. I look forward to expanding my portfolio over the course of this bootcamp to track my progress.
